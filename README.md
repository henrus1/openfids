# open FIDS

Open FIDS is a free, self hosted flight information display system that any airport can easily install on almost any every type of computer. The PHP and SQL based system provides different display options and allows for flight details to be communicated quickly to passengers. Best of all it's a free download and always will be (including every future update)!
